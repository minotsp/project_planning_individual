Another thing is how \"player\" is defined, whether one is considered a player when making an account, or a player when they start to play. Many players have 0 hours of playtime, and whether or not they are taken into consideration is important because this changes the value of the average time spent on the game dramatically (if they are considered, the mean is around 6 hours, and if they aren't, the mean is around 10 hours). A final issue could be related to ethics, in terms of how the research group may use this collected data without breaching the privacy of their players. "
